# PROMEOS

**PROMEOS** is a multimodal learning framework for protein-protein interaction prediction, leveraging a Mixture of Experts to integrate ontology and sequence embeddings.


## Model Architecture

</p>

<p align="left">
  <b>(a)</b> GO and sequence embeddings from a protein pair are concatenated and encoded through a Transformer encoder with sparse MoE layers.  
  The encoded representations are element-wise multiplied, followed by a weighted attention and a linear layer for final prediction.<br>
  <b>(b)</b> GO embeddings are derived from Node2Vec trained on a random walk corpus over the GO graph.  
  Red symbols next to GO terms indicate proteins annotated with those terms (e.g., $P_1$, $P_2$).<br>
  <b>(c)</b> Protein sequences are tokenized, truncated, and encoded using ESM-2; the resulting embeddings are reshaped to match the GO embedding dimension.
